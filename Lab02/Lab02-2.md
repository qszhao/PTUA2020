### Objectives

 - Understand the difference between different types of repositories

 - Create a branch
 - Learn how to use pull requests

### Instructions

#### Set up git client on local macine

 1. For the operating system on your laptop/desktop follow the instructions
    [here][git_cli] to install git for the command line.

#### Repositories and setting up

 1. Fork your individual repository from the organization account (qszhao/PTUA2020) to your
    individual GitHub repository (you should have done it in the first lab session).
 2. Get your [ssh keys][ssh] setup on your individual GitHub repository

#### Git on the Command Line

 1. Using the command line on your local machine, [clone][clone] your individual GitHub
    repository for the course.
 2. Create a [branch][branch] called `Lab02`
 3. Checkout the branch `Lab02`
 3. On the local machine create a new folder in the repository called `Lab02`
 4. In that folder create a python script called `Lab02.py` that prints out all
    odd numbers between 0 and 100.
 5. Add your `Lab02.py` to the repository 
 6. Commit
 7. Push your commits to the repos on your individual GitHub account

#### Pull Requests
 1. On your personal GitHub account create a [pull request][pr] based on the commits
    for this exercise. The target should be the `master`  branch of your individual repository on the
    organization account. The origin should be the `Lab02` branch on your personal remote GitHub repository.
