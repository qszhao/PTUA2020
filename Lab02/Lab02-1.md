## Lab02-1: Basic tools

### Objectives

 - Introduce the concept of shells
 - Explore the Python Interpretor
 - Learn basic editing
 - Investigate different modes of interaction with the Python interpretor

### Instructions

#### Shells

 1. If your computer runs MacOS or Linux, start a Shell in a new tab via Terminal. If your computer runs Windows, start a Windows Powershell instead. 
 2. Try out the command `man`
 3. What does `ls` do?
 4. What does `ls -al` do?
 5. What does `pwd` do?
 6. What does `mkdir` do?
 7. Create a directory called `PTUA2020`
 8. Look at your file browser.
 9. Refresh your file browser. Notice anything
 10. `cd PTUA2020`
 11. `pwd`
 12. `cd`
 13. What is your current working directory now?


#### Python Interpretor

 1. In your Anaconda Navigator or Shell, start a Python interpretor.
 2. How do you terminate a Python interpretor 'exit()'?
 3. Explore the Python help system
 4. What is the difference between interactive help and `help(object)`?
 5. How do you enter and exit interactive help?
 6. How many keywords are there in the Python language?

#### Editing

Compare using the File browser with the shell to accomplish the following

 1. If your computer runs MacOS or Linux, start a Shell in a new tab via Terminal. If your computer runs Windows, start a Windows Powershell instead.
 2. `cd PTUA2020`
 3. `mkdir exercises`
 4. `cd exercises`
 5. `mkdir Lab02`
 6. `cd Lab02`
 7. `pwd`
 8. `touch Lab02.py` (in Windows you need to create a python file by yourself)
 9. Open the Lab02.py by text editor and type in the follow python code: 
      message = "hello world"
      print message
 10. Save the python file and close it. 
 11. `ls`
 12. `cat Lab02.py`
 13. `python Lab02.py` (it may not work in the Powershell if you do not install python to your system before.)
 14. Now edit the file to change the content of the message.
 15. Check if it worked.

#### Use Linux and Python on Windows 10
  1. You can follow the steps in this [link][bash] to install a Linux system (i.e. Ubuntu or Debian) in your Windows OS.  
  2. Install Python through [Microsoft Store][python], then you can use it in PowerShell (you need to update your Windows 10 to the newest version).
